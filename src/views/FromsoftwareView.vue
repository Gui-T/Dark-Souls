    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      FromSoftware was founded as a business software developer by Naotoshi Zin
      in Tokyo, Japan, on November 1, 1986. In 1994, the company released its
      first game, King's Field. Despite its commercial success in Japan, the
      game was not released in North America, although King's Field II was
      released in both regions the following year. After releasing King's Field
      III, FromSoftware went on to release the horror game Echo Night and the
      role-playing game Shadow Tower in 1998. In 1997, FromSoftware released
      Armored Core, the first in a mecha video game series that spawned multiple
      sequels and spin-offs. The success of Armored Core solidified the
      company's development, and in July 1999, FromSoftware released the
      multiplayer action game Frame Gride. In 2000, with the launch of the
      PlayStation 2, FromSoftware released the role-playing games Eternal Ring
      and Evergrace. In 2003, FromSoftware published Tenchu: Wrath of Heaven, a
      stealth game that combines action and adventure elements. The company also
      released a pair of sequels to their PlayStation 1 offerings with King's
      Field IV and Shadow Tower Abyss. FromSoftware also released the Lost
      Kingdoms titles for the GameCube, a competing sixth generation console.
      IGN would note however that during this generation FromSoftware's focus
      would shift from RPGs to mech games due in part to the success of the
      Armored Core series. In 2002, FromSoftware released the mech action game
      Murakumo: Renegade Mech Pursuit for the Xbox before entering the mobile
      game market, where FromSoftware released another King's Field title. In
      2004, FromSoftware released another Xbox title, Metal Wolf Chaos. In 2005,
      FromSoftware would start to produce a series of licensed games based on
      the various anime properties under the banner Another Century's Episode.
      In the same year, the company hosted the video game industry's first
      internship that let students experience game development through a game
      creation kit, Adventure Player, for the PlayStation Portable. In 2008,
      FromSoftware underwent a stock split before entering the Nintendo Wii
      market to release Tenchu: Shadow Assassins. Game director Hidetaka
      Miyazaki became the president of FromSoftware in May 2014 and also serves
      as its representative director. In April 2014, Kadokawa Corporation
      announced its intention to purchase the company from former shareholder
      Transcosmos. The deal was finalized on May 21, 2014. In December 2015,
      FromSoftware was nominated for developer of the year at The Game Awards
      2015, but lost to CD Projekt Red. In January 2016, FromSoftware
      established a studio in Fukuoka that focuses on creating
      computer-generated imagery (CGI) assets for their games. Other games they
      have developed include the Enchanted Arms, King's Field, Chromehounds,
      Otogi, and Tenchu series. In 2009, FromSoftware released Demon's Souls for
      the PlayStation 3, which brought them international exposure. Its
      spiritual successor, Dark Souls, was released in 2011. In March 2014, Dark
      Souls II was released, while Dark Souls III was released in 2016. A title
      inspired by the Dark Souls series, Bloodborne, was released in March 2015
      to critical acclaim. They have also received a number of awards, primarily
      those for the role-playing genre, including multiple "RPG of the Year" and
      Game of the Year awards. Since release, Dark Souls and Bloodborne have
      been cited by many publications to be among the greatest games of all
      time. In April 2016, FromSoftware revealed that they were working on a new
      intellectual property, as well as stating their intent to return to the
      Armored Core series.Two games, the PlayStation VR exclusive Déraciné and
      the multiplatform Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, were announced at E3 2018.An
      action role-playing game featuring the collaboration of FromSoftware
      president Hidetaka Miyazaki and A Song of Ice and Fire series author
      George R. R. Martin, titled Elden Ring, was released in 2022.In August
      2022, it was announced that Sixjoy Hong Kong (a subsidiary of Tencent) and
      Sony Interactive Entertainment would acquire respectively 16.25% and
      14.09% of FromSoftware, leaving 69.66% of the company to Kadokawa
      Corporation.
